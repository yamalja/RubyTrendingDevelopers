## Installing Ruby and Sinatra

Install Ruby on your system by typing `sudo apt-get install ruby-full` in your terminal.
Check if Ruby was installed on the system using: `ruby -v`.
This should output some information about the installed Ruby version.

### Installing Sinatra

Just as you would install any other gem, Sinatra is installed like so:
`gem install sinatra`

**Alternatively** run `bundle install` to install all required Gems.

## Running the App
You have to options in order to run the application:
1. Either by typing `rackup` in the terminal, after changing directory to that file.
2. Or by compiling the **app.rb** by typing `ruby app.rb`.


The App is now up and running on your **localhost** address and on the default Sinatra port **9292**.
Right now you'll need to enter the following URL in the addressbar of your favourite browser: `http://localhost:9292/`. This will land you on the Homepage of my app.

#### Note
As long as the API-server of development down, this app is going to print out a Test-API sample made by the same developer of `github-trending-api`.
When the dev-server is up again, You're going to get back the daily trending Ruby developers on Github. Stay tuned!
